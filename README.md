# Beat_the_algorithm

This is the codebase for an online, browser based game. The object of the game is to test your skills at performing a task and trying to complete it faster than an algorithm set to a slowed down speed. Examples of challenges are sorting arrays, pathfinding and route optimisation.

In addition to being a bit of fun, this game aims to exhibit and teach the power and processes of certain algorithms to increase interest and understanding. It is also a chance for myself develop my algorithm, design and server skills.
